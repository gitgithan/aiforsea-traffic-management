Dear Evaluators,

Please run Traffic Management.ipynb from top to bottom to allow some of the intermediate data to be generated. 
The most important function that must be in defined in ram is def preprocess() which wraps 6 other preprocessing functions in the same cell.
This notebook has consistently hovered around 80% of my 16gb ram so 8gb may be a problem. I have been generously using del though to clean up.

To predict, please insert your dataframe into the last cell in my Traffic Management.ipynb, titled "Prediction on Test Set from Grab".
#test_from_grab = insert your test df here.

It was a great challenge that allowed me to learn things i wouldn't otherwise.

Thank you.
